Customize

Have a look at intents.json. You can customize it according to your own use case. Just define a new tag, possible patterns, and possible responses for the chat bot. You have to re-run the training whenever this file is modified.

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hey", "How are you", "Is anyone there?", "Hello", "Good day"],
      "responses": ["Hey :-)", "Hello, thanks for visiting", "Hi there, what can I do for you?", "Hi there, how can I help?"]
    },
    ...
  ]
